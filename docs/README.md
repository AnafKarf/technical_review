Here are some general comments on different aspects of the document:

## Content
The document is a recipe of lasagna. However, author called their document a "report". This naming is mesleading, since the document contains instructions rather than observations. 

Unfortunately, the document contains misleading or unclear information. 
Example: The author says to keep repeating until all ingredients are used, even though we should stop when at least one of the ingredients ends.

However, the author provided information usually ignored in other recipes.
Example: Here information about storage is provided, while other recipes often miss it.

## Format

Overall the document structure is consistent. However, sometimes the fonts do not allign with each other.
Example: Some of list elements are in bold font, while others are not. Compare first and second items in list.

## Structure

The document is easy to follow. However, some elements are situated strangely.
Example: Tips for preparation are located after the recipe is already finished, so the reader may have already prepared the dish, and cannot use the tips.

## Language

Language of the document is appropriate for intended reader (I suppose intended reader is a person not trained professionally in cooking).
However, unfortunately, there are some spelling errors.
Example: Lasagne instead of Lasagna

## Compliance

## Consistency

The author uses the same terminology across all document. However, somethimes the formatting is different, as stated in **Format** subsection of the review.

## Usability

The recipe is overall understable and easy to follow. 
However, it does contain unclear instructions (as stated in **Content**) subsection, as well as some low quality images.
Example:

## General opinion
The document is overall very helpful and pleasant to read. The author included certain points that similar documents often miss. However, the structure of the document could be improved, and more specific information could be added.
