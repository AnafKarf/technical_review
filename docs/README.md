## Content
The document is a recipe of lasagna. However, author called their document a "report". This naming is mesleading, since the document contains instructions rather than observations. 

Unfortunately, the document contains misleading or unclear information. Example:

## General opinion
The document is overall very helpful and pleasant to read. The author included certain points that similar documents often miss. However, the structure of the document could be improved.
